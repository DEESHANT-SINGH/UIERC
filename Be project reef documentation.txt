<h3>Macroalgae</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="info">
	    Marine macroalgae (seaweeds) have been traditionally used by coastal 
	    populations for food, feed, disease remedy, and organic fertilizer since ancient times.
            In addition, macroalgae are considered to be the major feed stocks 
            of renewable energy sources, such as bioethanol, biodiesel, or biogas.
            This is because these algal cells contain 15 to 20% polysaccharides, 
            a higher quantity than found in terrestrial plants

	    many research studies focused their interest on demonstrating the sustainability 
	    of exploiting marine macroalgal biomass as feedstock for wastewater treatment and 
            natural fertilizer, conversion into green biofuels, active ingredients in pharmaceutical 
            and nutraceutical products, or even for the production of functional ingredients and 
            integration in the human food chain.

<h3>Montipora</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="info">
	    Montipora is the second most species rich coral genus after Acropora.
	    Indo-Pacific -Montipora are a genus of small polyp stony corals found in reefs throughout the world. 
	    They are one of the primary reef building corals and are responsible for a large percentage of a reefâ€™s 
	    calcium carbonate structure.

	    Role in the habitat: Montipora corals are among the important building blocks of a reef. 
	    Together with Acropora coral (Acropora sp.), another member of the Family Acroporidae, 
	    montipora corals account for one-third of reef-building coral species. Those with branching 
            forms provide shelter for all kinds of animals including seahorses, tiny clams and all kinds of crabs.

	    Human uses: Montipora corals are taken from the wild for the live aquarium trade and wild colonies are 
            often taken from the natural reefs to supply this demand. There are efforts to cultivate some of the hardier, 
            faster-growing Montipora species for the live aquarium trade so as to reduce collection pressure from the wild. 
            Although captive bred corals are healthier and easier to care for than wild collected specimens, captive bred corals are more expensive.

<h3>Sand</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="info">
	    Coral sand is a collection of sand of particles originating in tropical and sub-tropical 
	    marine environments from bioerosion of limestone skeletal material of marine organisms.

	    the term "coral" in coral sand is used loosely in this sense to mean limestone of recent 
	    biological origin; corals are not the dominant contributors of sand particles to most such deposits. 
	    Rather, remnant skeletal fragments of foraminifera, calcareous algae, molluscs, and crustaceans can predominate. 
	    Because it is composed of limestone, coral sand is acid-soluble.
